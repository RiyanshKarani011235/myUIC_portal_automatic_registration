A lot of popular courses at UIC Computer Science department have a problem of getting filled up quite fast. This script, for me, almost gauranttes that I get the course I want by automating, using selenium, the monitoring of course seats status on the portal and notifying me whenever a course that I want is available.

Don't tell my classmates ;)
